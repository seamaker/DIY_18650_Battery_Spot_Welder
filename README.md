Ingredients:

DFRobot Relay Shield
Adafruit RGB LCD button shield
500 Amp truck starter relay
Really big motorcycle or small car lead-acid or SLA battery
Build at your own risk. This project is truly unsafe and should not be attempted by anybody, at any time, for any purpose. Short circuiting a starter battery through any conductive object is a really bad idea to start with. But, when controlled precisely, it can work wonders. This sketch provides that level of control in +/- 5 millisecond increments. 
Ideal basic burn time is defaulted to 35 milliseconds which works well with .15mm nickel strip on 18650 Lithium Ion or 26650 LiFePo4 cells. 
Enjoy, but don't say you weren't warned.
